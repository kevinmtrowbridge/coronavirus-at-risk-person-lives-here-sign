# "Coronavirus: An At Risk Person Lives Here" sign with Sketch source

We're finding a lot of the younger people are taking advantage of having college & school cancelled, work being WFH, to visit with friends and socialize. I imagine kids off from school, running around visiting their families, meanwhile spreading COVID-19 to them.  This is all perfectly natural, the brain is not done maturing until ~25 & some of the areas which develop last, are those which deal with estimating risk & consequences.  Personally, when I was 18, in this situation I absolutely would have gone to visit my grandpa.

A part of the challenge is communicating this risk: important things require frequent repetition and multiple forms of messaging.

For at risk people (older folks, those with weakened immune systems), having a sign like this printed and hanging on the front door might help.  It might not work the first time but, still could discourage subsequent visits:
